# How to Contribute

Thank you for considering making a contribution to Untapt!

## Issue assignments

Generally, all issues can be claimed by a developer. Unassigned issues are up for grabs. Make a comment asking to take up an unassigned issue.

Pull requests that close an issue not assigned to the requester are generally declined. We recommend not starting work on an issue until it has been assigned to you.

#### Issue reassignment

Issues that have had no activity by an assignee for a period of time will get pinged by a maintaiiner asking if more time is needed. The assignee can simply reply that more time is desired to keep the issue claimed. If instead there is no response in 48 hours, they will be unassigned, and the issue will be up for grabs
